Cue-1
00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.999
Every choice we make about 
the technology we use in our daily lives..

Cue-2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.500
..shapes the world. 

Cue-3
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.999
Think for example, about electric cars, 

Cue-4
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.499
..about the apps on your phone,
your computer, the Internet,

Cue-5
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.250
..the programs you use for work, or school.

Cue-6
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:17.999
The makers of these programs..

Cue-7
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.250
..build a convincing way of experiencing
the world.

Cue-8
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.499
But make no mistake, 

Cue-9
00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.000
..they do not serve you.

Cue-10
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:27.749
We end up with software..

Cue-11
00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.000
..that often deprives us of important rights and
freedoms. 

Cue-12
00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:32.999
With nonfree software, in a sense..

Cue-13
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.999
..we are walking in the dark.

Cue-14
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.249
We can't understand today's popular software
because it is mostly proprietary,

Cue-15
00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.999
..which means
our active participation is limited by design.

Cue-16
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.250
Instead, the software ends up controlling us.

Cue-17
00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:54.500
This is a story about how the world is,
and how it could be.

Cue-18
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.750
What happens when we don't look up?

Cue-19
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.500
What happens when we follow the breadcrumbs of
the promise of convenience?

Cue-20
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.499
Considering the presence of software in your life,

Cue-21
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.999
..shouldn't you be able to
look inside programs to see how they worked?

Cue-22
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.499
Shouldn't you be able to
use them however you wanted,

Cue-23
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.999
..make whatever changes you wanted,
and share them freely in your community?

Cue-24
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.499
To live in a world
where we <i>do</i> control our technology,

Cue-25
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.000
..we need software
that is free -- as in freedom.

Cue-26
00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.499
All software is basically
a set of instructions to a computer,

Cue-27
00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.999
..which come together
like building blocks to make up your program.

Cue-28
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.500
There is a global community of people that believe that software
should serve you, the user.

Cue-29
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.499
That <i>you</i> should be able to
freely access, make changes,

Cue-30
00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.999
..and share these building blocks
to your liking. 

Cue-31
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.750
And when you can,
we call it free software.

Cue-32
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.249
With free software,
you can not only check
that software does what it says it does,

Cue-33
00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.999
..like protect your privacy..

Cue-34
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.499
..you can also adjust it
to make it do something new,

Cue-35
00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:08.250
..something creative.
You can solve any issue that you can think of.

Cue-36
00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.249
We protect this freedom
by using a concept called copyleft.

Cue-37
00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.999
This makes it so that
all modified and extended versions of a program

Cue-38
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.999
..are required to be free (as in freedom) as well.

Cue-39
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.499
Software freedom is worth fighting for.

Cue-40
00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.000
As the user, you have the
power to demand change. 

Cue-41
00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:31.500
You can make conscious decisions toward freedom,
one step at a time.

Cue-42
00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:37.999
There are free as in freedom programs
that you can begin to use today,

Cue-43
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.499
..which provide an ethical replacement
for the apps on your computer or phone.

Cue-44
00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.999
Over time, you can replace more and more
of the parts of your digital life..

Cue-45
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.499
..with tools that respect your freedom, 

Cue-46
00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.999
..and help others to do the same,

Cue-47
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.750
..by learning about and advocating
for software freedom in your
home, school, and workplace.

Cue-48
00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.499
Every time you use free software,

Cue-49
00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:03.000
..you are helping to create a freer
existence for yourself, and for the rest of us, too.

Cue-50
00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.249
This just in!
Shocking new video from a schoolteacher..

Cue-51
00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:09.999
..who wandered into a cave
and found out what's really going on with these devices we're
all carry around in our pockets.

Cue-52
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.499
It turns out they're a
form of mind control,

Cue-53
00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.999
..and that the end game is
walking unconsciously right into the
mouths of monsters.

Cue-54
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.499
Free software is important,
not just when thinking of technology,

Cue-55
00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.750
..but it matters for a free society.

Cue-56
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.999
So from now on,
when you are speaking about any kind of freedom,

Cue-57
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.500
..please consider the role
that software plays in that cause.

Cue-58
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.500
The Free Software Foundation has been fighting for software freedom
since 1985.

Cue-59
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:40.000
The journey won't be over
until we've all climbed the ladder to freedom.

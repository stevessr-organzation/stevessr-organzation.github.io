Welcome, everyone. It is my pleasure to give a speech on “glimmer of light”. We are human being. We do not mean much to the Earth, but all to ourselves. 
Little we can do, just like glimmer of light, to the world.
During the pandemic, everyone felt lonely and helpless, however, some people did contributions to the public, which helps other to get through the hard time. It’s glimmer of light, showing kindness in people’s actions. Maybe nobody can ever remember their name, but everyone was warmed.
	As students, we don’t have much ability, but we can do small things to change the world, take for example, stay positive, learn more to improve ourselves and maintain on well with others. Unity is why we are so strong, unbreakable. Just like an old Chinese saying, “one chopstick is easy to break, while a bunch of chopsticks are not”. An action is a small change. when thousands and thousands of actions are connected to each, it will have a great influence on our life.
	So, next time when you consider yourself as useless one. Think of what you can do, instead of complain. After all, glimmer of light is better than nothing at all.
	That’s all, thank you for listening.
